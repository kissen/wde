wde: watch directory entries
============================

Output a message when a file gets added to or removed from a
directory. Only works on Linux because it uses
[inotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify). I use it to watch
`/dev`.


Usage
-----

* Call `wde` with any number of directories
* If the `-r` flag is set, directories are added recursively


Bugs
----

* It is written in C.
* [There already is a tool that does it.](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki)
